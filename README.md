# Java Projects Portfolio

This repository is my workspace for learning and practicing Java. It brings together class exercises, personal projects, and small experiments as I build my skills with object-oriented programming, data handling, and core development techniques.

I’ll continue using this space to stay organized, refine my work, and track my progress as I grow more confident with Java.

Focus Areas

 - Object-oriented programming

 - Class design and inheritance

 - Input validation and user interaction

 - Working with collections

 - Basic file handling

 - General programming practice
